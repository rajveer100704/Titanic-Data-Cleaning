# Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**End-to-end data cleaning and preprocessing of the Titanic dataset using Python. Covers handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling, outlier detection, and visualization.**

---

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare raw data for machine learning. Key steps include:

- Handling missing values using mean, median, and mode
- Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding)
- Normalizing and standardizing numerical features
- Detecting and removing outliers using boxplots
- Visualizing data distributions
- Preparing a clean dataset ready for ML models

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is used for this project.  
You can download it from [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  

> Note: You can include the dataset in the repo if it is small, otherwise provide a download link.
